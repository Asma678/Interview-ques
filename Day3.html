    </h1><b>Interview Questions</b></h1>
    

      <b> Q.1: Difference between flex row and column?</b><br>
      A.1:Grid is made for two-dimensional layout while Flexbox is for one.
       This means Flexbox can work on either row or columns at a time, but Grids can work on both.
       Flexbox, gives you more flexibility while working on either element (row or column).<br><br>

      <b> Q.2:Explain inline , internal and external stylesheet?</b><br>
      A.2:As Inline has the highest priority, any styles that are defined in the internal and external style sheets are overridden by Inline styles.
       Internal or Embedded stands second in the priority list and overrides the styles in the external style sheet.
       External style sheets have the least priority.<br><br>

      <b>Q.3:Justify-content allows you to do what?</b><br>
      A.3:It is sub property of flex.
       The justify-content property aligns the flexible container's items when the items do not use all available space on the main-axis (horizontally).
        <br><br>
      <b> Q.4:Difference between absolute and relative positioning?</b><br>
      A.4:Absolute Position: An absolute position element is positioned relative to the first parent element that has a position other than static.
      An element with position: absolute; allows you to place any element exactly where you want it to be.
     You use the positioning attributes top, left, bottom. and right to set the location.
     It gets removed from the normal flow of elements on the page.
      An element with this type of positioning is not affected by other elements and also it doesn't affect flow of other elements.<br>
       Relative Position:relative positioned element is positioned relative to its normal position.
       An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.
       But if you do add some other positioning attribute, say, top: 10px;, it will shift its position 10 pixels down from where it would normally be.
       An element with this type of positioning gets affected by other elements and it itself also affects others.<br><br>

      <b> Q.5:What is grid-template-columns used for?</b><br>
      A.5:The grid-template-columns CSS property is part of the CSS Grid Layout specification,
       defining the columns of a grid container by specifying the size of the grid tracks and its line names.
       It’s worth noting the difference between grid lines and grid tracks as we dig into the grid-template-columns property. 
       Grid lines refer to the names of the lines that define the grid’s columns and rows. 
       Grid tracks refer to the length of space between grid lines.<br><br>

      <b> Q.6:What is the z-index in CSS?</b><br>
      A.6:Z Index ( z-index ) is a CSS property that defines the order of overlapping HTML elements. 
      Elements with a higher index will be placed on top of elements with a lower index.
     Note: Z index only works on positioned elements ( position:absolute , position:relative , or position:fixed ).<br><br>

      <b> Q.7:What is the difference between padding and margin?</b><br>
      A.7:In CSS, a margin is the space around an element's border, while padding is the space between an element's border and the element's content.
       Put another way, the margin property controls the space outside an element, and the padding property controls the space inside an element.<br><br>

      <b> Q.8:What is box sizing?</b><br>
      A.8:The box-sizing CSS property sets how the total width and height of an element is calculated.
      The box-sizing property can be used to adjust this behavior:
      1.content-box gives you the default CSS box-sizing behavior.
      2.border-box tells the browser to account for any border and padding in the values you specify for an element's width and height. <br><br>

      <b> Q.9:What is animation delay?</b><br>
      A.9:The animation-delay CSS property specifies the amount of time to wait from applying the animation to an element before beginning to perform the animation. 
      The animation can start later, immediately from its beginning, or immediately and partway through the animation.<br><br>

      <b>Q.10:Which property you will use to merge cells vertically in grid?</b><br>
      A.10:Grid-colum-start and grid-colum-end short hand property:grid-colum<br><br>

      <b> Q.11:Which property you will use to merge cells horizontally in grid?</b><br>
      A.11:Grid-row-start and grid-row-end short hand property.<br><br>

      <b>Q.12:Explain CSS box model?</b><br>
      A.12:In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.
      The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. 
      It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.<br><br>
    

      <b> Q.13:what is the difference between display none and visibility hidden?</b><br>
      A.13:Both are property of css use to hide element.
        display:none means that the tag in question will not appear on the page at all (although you can still interact with it through the dom).
         There will be no space allocated for it between the other tags. visibility:hidden means that unlike display:none, the tag is not visible, but space is allocated for it on the page.<br><br>
